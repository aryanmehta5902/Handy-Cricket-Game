# Hand-Cricket-Game

I developed an interactive hand cricket 2-player game that enables players to engage in a friendly cricket battle. The game algorithm keeps track of the number of runs scored by the players. Players are allowed to score between 1 to 5 runs. On one side of the screen, the bowler positions his/her hands, while on the other side, the batter positions their hand. The game continuously monitors their hand gestures. If the number of fingers shown by both players is the same, the batter is declared out; otherwise, the batter's run total increases.
